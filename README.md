# design-patterns-with-type-script
 This is just a opensource repository where I will practice the implementation of different design patterns. Feel free to review and reuse my code and feel free to share your feedback.


 ## Project execution command

Each and every design pattern are arranged in separate `directory` by their name. To execute those, all we have to do is to put the following command and a proper file location.

    npx ts-node ./FILE_LOCATION
